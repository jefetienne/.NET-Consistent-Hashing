#About

A fork from Burtsev Alexey's original .NET object deep copying extension, I inserted a hashing algorithm into the program, and stripped the deep-copying components of it to improve performance.

With .NET's GetHashCode(), the value is essentially the memory address of the object. With this extension, any object you create, it will generate a consistently hashed (ulong) value based off of all of its properties, as well as its Type. This way, a double '34.5' and a String "34.5" will have different hash codes.
